The novel is set on June 16, 1904, and is famously known as \"Bloomsday,\" a day celebrated by Joyce enthusiasts around the world. While the events of the novel are fictional, they are inspired by real locations and people in Dublin, and the city's streets and landmarks are integral to the narrative. The novel's setting is a significant part of its cultural and literary significance, and it has become a symbol of Dublin's rich literary heritage. The detailed depiction of Dublin in \"Ulysses\" has also contributed to the city's reputation as a literary capital, attracting visitors and scholars interested in exploring the places that inspired Joyce's work. The novel's setting is not just a backdrop but a character in itself, shaping the story and the experiences of the characters. The city of Dublin is thus central to the novel's themes and narrative, making it a key element of the work's enduring appeal. The answer is Dublin"
